# Architecture

## Overview
An HTTP service for append-based personal logs.
It accepts log entries over a REST API, stores them durably in JSONL files (source of truth), and maintains a SQLite index for fast querying.

The mutex and locks of data changes is based on flock -- prevents concurrency on OS-dir level.

## CQS
Logic of service organically divided into command and query.
- **Command** (`internal/domain/command`): state-changing operations, such as JSONL append + SQLite index update.
- **Query** (`internal/domain/query`): retrieval operations that may reorganize data for response, such as SQLite selecting matching JSONL files → JSONL scan + entry-level filtering.

Currently synchronous. The command storage boundary is compatible with future async indexing.

## Layering
```
slog-http middleware              ← RequestID, access logs
internal/httpapi/*                ← parse, validate, respond
internal/domain/{command,query}   ← business logic, owns interfaces
internal/infrastructure/*         ← storage, indexing, and external adapters
```
Dependencies flow inward. Interfaces defined at the usage-model-level.

## Handler Segregation

Handlers under `internal/httpapi/` mirror the CQS split so that read and write paths evolve independently — different validation rules, status codes, and future middleware (e.g. rate limiting writes only).
`httpapi/command` owns mutation concerns; `httpapi/query` owns read concerns; `httpapi/registry` is stateless schema discovery with no domain coupling.
Shared utilities (`response.go`, `errors.go`, `middleware.go`) are kept at the `httpapi/` root to avoid duplication without blurring the command/query boundary.

## Infrastructure Split

`internal/infrastructure/` contains focused packages rather than one facade:
Each package maps one technical capability to the domain interfaces that use it.

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `commandstore` | Write path: JSONL append + index update |
| `querystore` | Read path: matching file lookup → JSONL scan |
| `index` | Finds JSONL files that may contain matching entries |
| `jsonlstore` | Raw JSONL file I/O |
| `sourcerepo` | Source-ID ↔ name resolution |

## Observability
- RequestID in every JSONL entry + `X-Request-ID` header
- `slog.JSONHandler` structured logging
- `expvar`: `records_appended`, `sqlite_index_latency_ms` at `/debug/vars`

## API Convention
The API follows the main guidelines of [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification.
Before making API design decisions, consult the spec and its addendums first.

## Trade-offs

| Decision | Revisit when |
|----------|-------------|
| Synchronous write+index | Write latency matters |
| expvar metrics | Need Prometheus/OTel |
| No auth | Exposed to untrusted network |
| File-level index (not per-entry) | Need sub-file granularity |
